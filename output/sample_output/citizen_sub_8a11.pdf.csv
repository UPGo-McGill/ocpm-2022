22,citizen_sub_8a11,LETTER,"The current configuration entails the following problems ([1] p.34, [2] p.1619): • Buses must circulate through shared city streets in order to service an intermediate stop in Griffintown • The Downtown Terminus or Terminus Centre-Ville (TCV) is currently operating above capacity and cannot accommodate all of the buses, many of which must now stop outdoors • There is no marshaling/waiting area adjacent to the TCV, and many buses must wait, often at idle, on nearby city streets • Buses typically travel empty half of the time due to the pendulum nature of displacements While the SHM's proposed Dalhousie Bus Corridor would allow buses to follow a reserved, shortestdistance route from the Peel Basin to the TCV, this configuration only addresses the first of the aforementioned problems.",en
